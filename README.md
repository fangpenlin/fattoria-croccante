==================

A Cornerstore example shop and boilerplate

## About the Fattoria

This repository contains a Rails 4 project that uses Cornerstore to build an online shop frontend.
The frontend itself is very basic and by no means shows all the awesome posiblities that are possible
with Cornerstore. However it is a good starting point to check out how the Cornerstore gem works and to
give you a head start for your new e-commerce project.
